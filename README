App-Toodledo

Toodledo (http://www.toodledo.com/) is a web-based capability for managing
to-do lists along Getting Things Done (GTD) lines.  This module
provides a Perl-based access to its API.

What do you need the API for?  Doesn't the web interface do everything
you want?  Not always.  See the examples included with this distribution.
For instance, Toodledo has only one level of notification and it's either
on or off.  With the API you can customize the heck out of notification.
